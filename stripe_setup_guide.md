## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add these to your backend `.env` file:

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_test_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_test_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 2. Database Migration
Run the database migration to add Stripe fields:

```sql
-- From project root
mysql -u your_username -p your_database < stripe_migration.sql
```

### 3. Test Stripe Keys
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
2. Copy your **test** keys (they start with `pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)
3. Add them to your environment variables

## 🧪 Testing Phase 1

### Test Admin Flow (Stripe Connect Setup)

1. **Access Payment Settings**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/org/[organizationId]/dashboard/settings/payments
   ```

2. **Create Stripe Connect Account**
   - Click "Setup Stripe" button
   - Should create a Stripe Connect account for the organization

3. **Complete Onboarding**
   - Click "Complete Setup" to start Stripe Connect onboarding
   - Fill out the required information in Stripe's interface
   - Return to your application

4. **Verify Setup**
   - Payment settings should show "Ready to Accept Payments"
   - Account status should be "enabled"

### Test Donor Flow (Payment Processing)

1. **Access Donation Form**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/organization/[organizationId]/campaign/[campaignId]/donation-form
   ```

2. **Fill Out Donation Form**
   - Select an amount
   - Fill in donor information
   - Click "Credit Card" payment method

3. **Test Payment**
   - Use Stripe test card numbers:
     - Success: `4242424242424242`
     - Decline: `4000000000000002`
     - Requires 3D Secure: `4000002500003155`

4. **Verify Transaction**
   - Check your admin dashboard for the transaction
   - Verify webhook events in Stripe dashboard

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Success Indicators
- ✅ Organization can create Stripe Connect account
- ✅ Onboarding redirects work properly
- ✅ Payment settings show correct status
- ✅ Donation form loads Stripe Elements
- ✅ Test payments process successfully
- ✅ Transactions appear in database with Stripe IDs
- ✅ Webhooks update transaction statuses

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. "Stripe publishable key not configured"**
- Ensure `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set in backend `.env`
- Restart backend server after adding environment variables

**2. "Organization does not have Stripe payments set up"**
- Complete Stripe Connect onboarding first
- Check organization's `stripe_account_id` in database

**3. "Payment intent creation failed"**
- Verify organization's Stripe account is enabled for charges
- Check Stripe dashboard for any account restrictions

**4. Webhooks not working**
- Set up webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard pointing to `/api/stripe/webhook`
- Ensure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe dashboard

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Database Queries to Check Status

```sql
-- Check Stripe Connect accounts
SELECT id, name, stripe_account_id, stripe_account_status, stripe_onboarding_completed 
FROM organizations 
WHERE stripe_account_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Check Stripe transactions
SELECT id, campaign_id, amount, status, stripe_payment_intent_id, processing_fee, net_amount
FROM transactions 
WHERE stripe_payment_intent_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Check webhook events
SELECT id, event_type, processed, created_at 
FROM stripe_webhook_events 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Stripe Dashboard Monitoring
- Monitor payments in [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)
- Check Connect accounts in [Connect section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/accounts)
- View webhook logs in [Webhooks section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks)
